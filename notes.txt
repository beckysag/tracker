ISSUES:
- edit form needs to check if no data was posted, and go away


- create and document predefined admin users

- do we want to keep the user email as part of the registration stuff?

- organize OS's?

- go thru user stories


- scripts/add.php: add validation for item attribetus before writing to database (esp that pages is a number)


Search:
- make sure the search takes all fields into account
- add accessories listing to detail page

- consolidate css







- look at htaccess file, make sure all necessary files are protected (files in accts/views have to be protected from direct access, esp views/edit.php - it assuems a value exists for $addoredit in the php script)
